# Islands
### a game by Marty Taylor

## What is this?

Some years ago I was playing Minecraft and I generated a world that dropped in me in a large archipelago (I believe the seed was _Wikipedia_, for those interested in it.)
Anyway, from that day I had this vague idea for a game where you could explore different islands, each one being different. This game is getting me closer to that goal.

## Are there bugs? Is it finished?

There are tons of bugs and it is by no means finished. I just thought this would be a nice way to track its progress. It may never be finished (somewhat in the vein of _Dwarf Fortress_).
