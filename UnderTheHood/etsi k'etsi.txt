Another time, another day,
another thing I meant to say.
Is there so much that I should know?
What happens if I learn too slow?
Think everyone's ahead of me;
I'm back one step and they're up three.
And while I know it's the first day,
I wanna get this underway.

How are you feeling? Έτσι κ'έτσι.
How are you feeling? Έτσι κ'έτσι.
How are you feeling? Έτσι κι έτσι.

When you get the hang of things,
it's like your soul stands up and sings.
I should be patient to prevail,
cause I can't learn unless I fail.
But how much failure can I make?
It's such a bitter pill to take.
All my attempts just seem so sad.
The basics never hurt so bad.

How are you feeling? Έτσι κ'έτσι.
How are you feeling? Έτσι κ'έτσι.
How are you feeling? Έτσι κι έτσι.

Better get better (Έτσι κ'έτσι)
Better get better (Έτσι κ'έτσι)
Better get better (Έτσι κι έτσι)
